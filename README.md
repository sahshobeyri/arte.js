# arte.js 🎨

✨ a repository where i would like to decorate with various pieces of art, powered by JS.

📖 «Arte» is a Spanish word meaning (guess what?) «Art».
 
🎩 At the same time, it can be a Persian informal statement meaning «it's art.»

## how to see the art
- open the folder
- run any http-server you like (i use node http-server) and serve index.html
- open the 👀 of your ❤️
